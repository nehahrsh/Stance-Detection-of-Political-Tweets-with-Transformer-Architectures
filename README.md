# Stance-Detection-of-Political-Tweets-with-Transformer-Architectures

#### Stance detection AI model that employs sentiment analysis to assess user stances towards political issues on social media and predicts election results regarding controversial policies, namely Californiaâ€™s Prop 16, with a joint accuracy of 82%.

## Built With 
#### *Python* (https://www.python.org/)
#### *Twitter API*
#### *Matplotlib* (https://matplotlib.org/)
#### *Scikit-learn* (https://scikit-learn.org/)
#### *Pandas* (https://pandas.pydata.org/)
#### *NumPy* (https://numpy.org) 

## Goals
#### 1. Train relevancy classifier for tweets relating to Prop 16
#### 2. Create stance detection model to determine the political perspectives on localized policies of social media (Twitter) users. 
#### 3. Apply the model to predict the outcome of local policy based elections.
